Vertex_Group_Suffix-Prefix_remover-in-Blender-VRChat

Removes a string of text from all vertex groups of an object 

Lots of clothes and accessories for vrchat will often have suffixes like "_PD" after perfectly matching vertex groups to bones. 
This is very annoying for blender since its batch renamer cant rename vertex groups and removing those additions is a pain in the ass
This tool eliminates that pain. 

Feel free to edit or use this for whatever
